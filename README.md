Hey, I'm Caspian!

I recently graduated from Bowdoin College, and I'm now helping build AGI at [Magic](https://magic.dev/).
At Bowdoin, I spent a few years building a retro action-platformer game called [Dungeon Dave](https://github.com/CaspianA1/dungeon_dave). I also contributed to various technical projects at [WBOR](https://wbor.org/), Bowdoin's student-run radio station. 

In my free time, you can find me taking apart my espresso gear, learning new languages, rock climbing, geeking out about computer graphics, and much more.

[Here's](https://github.com/CaspianA1) my GitHub page.
